Working with Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) in version control is indeed challenging because they're JSON files containing outputs, metadata, and execution counts that create noisy diffs. Here are the best approaches:

## 1. **Use nbdime (Recommended)**
This is a tool specifically designed for diffing and merging notebooks:

```bash
pip install nbdime

# Enable git integration
nbdime config-git --enable --global
```

This gives you:
- **Better diffs**: `git diff` shows readable notebook changes
- **Merge tool**: `git mergetool` opens a web-based 3-way merge interface
- **Web diff viewer**: `nbdiff-web notebook.ipynb` to visualize changes

## 2. **Strip outputs before committing**
Use a pre-commit hook to clear outputs automatically:

```bash
pip install nbstripout

# Set it up for your repo
nbstripout --install
```

This removes all cell outputs before commits, making diffs much cleaner. You only track code and markdown, not results.

## 3. **Use Jupytext (Convert to .py files)**
Convert notebooks to paired Python files:

```bash
pip install jupytext

# Pair notebook with a Python script
jupytext --set-formats ipynb,py:percent notebook.ipynb
```

Now you get both:
- `.ipynb` for working (gitignored or with stripped outputs)
- `.py` file that's easy to diff/merge in git

## My Recommendation
**Start with nbdime + nbstripout** - this is the easiest approach:

1. Install both tools
2. Enable nbdime git integration
3. Set up nbstripout to auto-strip outputs
4. Continue working normally in VSCode

This way you get clean diffs, easy merges, and don't change your workflow. If you still have merge conflicts, `git mergetool` will open nbdime's visual merge tool automatically.

## Editor-Independent Solutions

**nbdime, nbstripout, and Jupytext all work at the git level**, not the editor level. They integrate with git itself, so it doesn't matter if you use VSCode, vim, neovim, or any other editor.

### How it works:

1. **nbdime** - hooks into git commands:
   - `git diff` automatically uses nbdime
   - `git mergetool` opens a web browser (works from any terminal)
   - No editor configuration needed

2. **nbstripout** - runs as a git filter:
   - Automatically strips outputs when you `git add`
   - Completely transparent to the editor
   - Just works in the background

3. **Jupytext** - syncs files on save:
   - The `.py` file is always in sync with `.ipynb`
   - Vim/neovim users can edit the `.py` file directly
   - Changes sync back to `.ipynb`

### For vim/neovim users specifically:

If your collaborator prefers vim/neovim, they might actually **prefer editing the .py file** created by Jupytext instead of the notebook JSON. They can:

```bash
# Edit the Python file
vim notebook.py

# Changes automatically sync to notebook.ipynb
```

This is often easier than editing raw `.ipynb` JSON in vim!

### The workflow:
- **You**: Work in VSCode with notebooks
- **Collaborator**: Works in vim with the paired `.py` files
- **Git**: Handles syncing via Jupytext, shows clean diffs via nbdime

Does your collaborator currently edit `.ipynb` files directly in vim, or would they prefer working with Python files?

In that case, **nbdime + nbstripout** is still your best solution, and it works perfectly with vim!

## Setup for both of you:

### One-time setup (both you and collaborator):

```bash
# Install the tools
pip install nbdime nbstripout

# Enable nbdime for git
nbdime config-git --enable --global

# Enable nbstripout for the repo (run in repo directory)
nbstripout --install
```

### How it works in practice:

**When editing in vim:**
- Your collaborator edits the notebook normally in vim
- When they save and commit, nbstripout automatically strips outputs
- When they run `git diff`, they see clean, readable diffs (not JSON noise)
- When there's a merge conflict, they run `git mergetool` and it opens nbdime's web interface in their browser

**When editing in VSCode:**
- Same thing! You edit normally, outputs are stripped on commit
- Clean diffs, easy merges

### Example workflow with merge conflicts:

```bash
# Pull changes
git pull
# CONFLICT in notebook.ipynb

# Open merge tool (opens in browser automatically)
git mergetool

# Web interface shows 3-way merge with rendered notebooks
# Resolve conflicts visually, save

# Complete the merge
git commit
```

The key is that **nbdime's merge tool opens in a web browser**, so it doesn't matter what editor you use. Even pure terminal users can use it - it just launches their default browser.

This is the simplest solution that requires no change to anyone's workflow. Both of you just install these two tools once, and git becomes much more notebook-friendly.
